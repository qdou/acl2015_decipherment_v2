\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

We propose a new framework that simultaneously performs decipherment and learns a cross-lingual mapping of word embeddings. The mapping is used to give decipherment a better base distribution. Our method is both theoretically sound and practically powerful. 

Experimental results show that our new algorithm improves state-of-the-art decipherment accuracy significantly: from 29\% to 64.7\% for Spanish/English, and 5.1\% to 11.2\% for Malagasy/English. This improvement could lead to further advances in using monolingual data to improve end-to-end MT.
In the future, we will work on making the new method scale to much larger vocabulary sizes, and apply it to improve MT systems.
