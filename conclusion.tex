\section{Conclusion and Future Work}


We proposed a new framework that simultaneously performs decipherment and learns a cross-lingual mapping of word embeddings. Our method is both theoretically appealing and practically powerful. The mapping is used to give decipherment a better base distribution. 

Experimental results show that our new algorithm improved state-of-the-art decipherment accuracy significantly: from 45.8\% to 67.4\% for Spanish/English, and 5.1\% to 11.2\% for Malagasy/English. This improvement could lead to further advances in using monolingual data to improve end-to-end MT.

In the future, we will work on making the our approach scale to much larger vocabulary sizes using noise contrastive estimation~\cite{gutmann2010noise}, and apply it to improve MT systems.
